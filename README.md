# KeyD
Secure Key Deduplication is a combination of convergent encryption and ID based broadcast encryption to achieve secure and efficient convergent key management, without introducing any other independent key management servers or trusted third parties.
In client-side schemes, each data copy is uploaded just once. When users upload duplicate data, they will be informed by the CSP about the duplication and need not upload the file any longer.
File-level deduplication eliminates duplicate data files, while block-level deduplication eliminates duplicate blocks in different files.
